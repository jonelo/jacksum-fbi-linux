# Jacksum File Browser Integration on GNU/Linux

The installer script can install Jacksum's primary features to the GNU/Linux File Browser's Script Menu.
Caja, Dolphin, Konqueror, Krusader, Nemo, Nautilus, ROX-Filer, Thunar, and Xfe are supported.

The script requires bash in order to run properly.
It expects both jacksum.jar and license.txt in the same directory where the script is stored.
